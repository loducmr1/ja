First you can see I have one folder here and in this folder I have one more folder called images.

Let me open this one and you can see I have so many images here that I will be using on my website.

Let's come back to this folder and here will create a new file and it will rename it as index.html.


I will open my html file with any text editor I am using VS Code.

And here will create a new file and this time I'm writing the file image a style.css says let's open

this file with text editor and here will write this code margin 0 and padding 0.

Now we will connect the html file with the CSS with this line of code.

I am writing Link rel as talented iterative and the phylum that is a stylus here says

here will add one more line meter name is  viewFort content width equal to device width

initially scale 1.0 so it will help us to make the web page responsive

because we will use the bootstrap so open thge website get a bootstrap dot com then and scroll down and

Just copy everything and paste it here in the head.

We can remove this part.

It is not compulsory.

Let's come back to the page again and just copy all these script copy and paste it here.

Again we can remove this part and the second script.

We don't need just delete this one
